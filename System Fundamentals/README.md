## All the programs were written in C in Linux OS.

* hw1 - A command line utility to encrypt and decrypt strings and files. The first encryption scheme is a Polybius cipher and the second is a Fractionated Morse cipher.

* hw2 - A program that translates Unicode files between UTF-8, UTF-16LE, and UTF-16BE formats.

* hw3 - A segregated free list allocator for the x86-64 architecture that manages up to 4 pages of memory at a time with the following features:
    - Four explicit free lists
    - A first-fit placement policy
    - Immediate coalescing on free with blocks at higher memory addresses
    - Block splitting without creating splinters.
    Implementation of my own versions of the **malloc**, **realloc**, and **free** functions.

* hw4 - A shell which supports some basic operations.

* hw5 - An in-memory, multi-threaded, caching server similar to [__Memcached__](https://memcached.org/).
* hw5_client - A client that can be used for testing and debugging the hw5 server.
